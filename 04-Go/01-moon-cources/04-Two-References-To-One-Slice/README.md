- 考察点：a和b都指向一个slice，修改b观察a的变化
- 解释：
```
This is a Go programming language code that demonstrates the behavior of slices in Go. Slices are dynamically-sized arrays in Go, and they are a powerful and flexible feature of the language.

The code creates a slice a containing the integers 1, 2, and 3. The cap and len functions are used to print the capacity and length of the slice, respectively.

The next line creates a new slice b that points to the same underlying array as a. This is because slices in Go are reference types, so when we assign b to a, we are not creating a new copy of the array, but rather a new reference to the same array.

The next line modifies the first element of b to 4, and the output shows that this also modifies the first element of a, since both a and b are pointing to the same underlying array.

The next line appends the integer 5 to b. This causes b to exceed its capacity, so Go creates a new array with double the capacity of the previous array, copies the contents of the old array to the new array, and then appends the new element. The output shows that the capacity of b has doubled to 6, while the capacity of a remains the same at 3.

Finally, the code prints the contents of a and b, which are both now [4 2 3] and [4 2 3 5], respectively.
